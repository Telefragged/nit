description: Drive a change through nit's review loop — push each completed commit for review, watch for the reviewer with a monitor, answer feedback by amending in place, and land it once approved. Use whenever work should go through nit ("drive it through nit", "push for review", "land via nit") or when acting on reviewer feedback on an existing chain.

# nit:lifecycle — drive a change through review

The loop for getting a change reviewed in nit: push as you build, watch for the
reviewer, answer feedback by amending in place, land once approved. Pair it
with the `comment` skill for talking to the reviewer.

Run `nit` from `PATH`; if it isn't installed, use
`nix run github:Telefragged/nit -- <args>` (run `/nit:install` to set it up).
The server defaults to `$NIT_SERVER` or `http://127.0.0.1:8877`. The repo must
already be registered (`nit repo create --base <branch>`, which `/nit:install`
does) — a push into an unregistered repo is a 404.

## Push as you build

Pushing is part of finishing a commit, not a later phase. The moment a commit
is done, push it — an unpushed commit is invisible to the reviewer.

```sh
# after EVERY completed commit:
nit push --partial      # registers the commit; the first push starts review
# after the LAST commit of the unit:
nit ready               # clears the partial flag
```

`--partial` marks work in flight (review can start, merging can't); it is
sticky until `nit ready`. Run both from inside the worktree — they resolve the
repo and tip from the checked-out commit. Report the first push so the reviewer
knows review has started. Keep the commits small and don't ration them; the
reviewer is never blocked by more commits.

## Watch for feedback with a monitor

Whenever the chain is open and you have nothing else to do, a watcher must be
running — never end a turn with an open chain and nothing watching it.

Run a parked monitor under the **Monitor tool** (set it persistent), not under
background `Bash`:

```sh
nit log --follow --oneline --reviewer-only --chain <tip_change_id> 0
```

`--follow` streams each new entry as it lands and never exits — so a background
`Bash` task (which only notifies you when a command _exits_) would silently
swallow the stream. The Monitor tool turns each relayed line into a
notification you act on. `--reviewer-only` mutes your own echoes;
`<tip_change_id>` is the numeric chain id from `nit push`/`nit status`; `0`
streams from the start (resume after a restart by passing the last seq you
saw). Re-point the monitor at the new tip as you stack more commits.

Each relayed line is a doorbell: read the full picture with `nit status`, and
use `nit log` for entry detail. Its positional argument is a range of log
positions, not a single index — a bare `N` reads only position `N`:

```sh
nit log --chain <tip_change_id> N..   # all log entries from index N on
```

`..` (the default) reads everything. Act on all of it, then let the monitor
keep streaming.

## Acting on state

`nit status` prints the chain `state`:

- **`agents_turn`** — act now. For each change marked `changes_requested` /
  `commented`:
  - code feedback → fix it by amending the commit in place (keep it one
    commit), then `nit push` — the rewritten commit lands as a new revision and
    the reviewer sees an interdiff. Then reply on the thread and resolve it (the
    `comment` skill).
  - a question → answer it on its thread (the `comment` skill).
  - (On a partial chain with everything approved, `agents_turn` just means the
    reviewer is caught up — keep building or `nit ready`.)
- **`waiting_for_review`** — the ball is with the reviewer; keep the monitor
  running.
- **`approved`** — every change is approved. Land it per this project's approve
  action (your project config records it). Drive it to `merged`.
- **`merged` / `abandoned`** — the chain is closed. Stop the monitor.

Never submit a review verdict yourself — that is the human's side. Your surface
is push / ready / status / log / comment.
